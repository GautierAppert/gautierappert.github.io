## Bio

* I am a French PhD Candidate in Statistics at CREST-ENSAE, under the direction of Dr. Olivier Catoni (CNRS Research Director). 
As a member of the Laboratory of Statistics, I am mainly working on various type of k-means and PAC-Bayesian theory with application to images. 


* I graduated from ENSAE ParisTech, completing an Engineer's degree in Data Science, and from ENS Paris-Saclay, completing a MSc in Mathematics, Vision and Machine Learning. 
I also hold a MSc in Statistics and Econometrics from Toulouse School of Economics.
